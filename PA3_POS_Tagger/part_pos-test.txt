No , 
[ it ]
[ was n't Black Monday ]
. 
But while 
[ the New York Stock Exchange ]
did n't 
[ fall ]
apart 
[ Friday ]
as 
[ the Dow Jones Industrial Average ]
plunged 
[ 190.58 points ]
-- most of 
[ it ]
in 
[ the final hour ]
-- 
[ it ]
barely managed to stay 
[ this side ]
of 
[ chaos ]
. 
[ Some ]
`` 
[ circuit breakers ]
'' installed after 
[ the October 1987 crash ]
failed 
[ their first test ]
, 
[ traders ]
say , unable to cool 
[ the selling panic ]
in 
[ both ]
[ stocks ]
and 
[ futures ]
. 
[ The 49 stock specialist firms ]
on 
[ the Big Board floor ]
-- 
[ the buyers ]
and 
[ sellers ]
of 
[ last resort ]
[ who ]
were criticized after 
[ the 1987 crash ]
-- once again could n't handle 
[ the selling pressure ]
. 
[ Big investment banks ]
refused to step up to 
[ the plate ]
to support 
[ the beleaguered floor traders ]
by buying 
[ big blocks ]
of 
[ stock ]
, 
[ traders ]
say . 
[ Heavy ]
selling of 
[ Standard ]
& 
[ Poor 's 500-stock index futures ]
in 
[ Chicago ]
relentlessly beat 
[ stocks ]
downward . 
[ Seven Big Board stocks ]
-- 
[ UAL ]
, 
[ AMR ]
, 
[ BankAmerica ]
, 
[ Walt Disney ]
, 
[ Capital Cities\/ABC ]
, 
[ Philip Morris ]
and 
[ Pacific Telesis Group ]
-- stopped trading and never resumed . 
[ The finger-pointing ]
has already begun . 
`` 
[ The equity market ]
was illiquid . 
Once again { 
[ the specialists ]
 } were not able to handle 
[ the imbalances ]
on 
[ the floor ]
of 
[ the New York Stock Exchange ]
, '' said 
[ Christopher Pedersen ]
, 
[ senior vice president ]
at 
[ Twenty-First Securities Corp ]
. 
[ Countered James Maguire ]
, 
[ chairman ]
of 
[ specialists Henderson Brothers Inc. ]
: `` 
[ It ]
is easy to say 
[ the specialist ]
is n't doing 
[ his job ]
. 
When 
[ the dollar ]
is in 
[ a free-fall ]
, even 
[ central banks ]
ca n't stop 
[ it ]
. 
[ Speculators ]
are calling for 
[ a degree ]
of 
[ liquidity ]
[ that ]
is not there in 
[ the market ]
. 
'' 
[ Many money managers ]
and 
[ some traders ]
had already left 
[ their offices early Friday afternoon ]
on 
[ a warm autumn day ]
-- because 
[ the stock market ]
was so quiet . 
Then in 
[ a lightning plunge ]
, 
[ the Dow Jones ]
industrials in barely 
[ an hour ]
surrendered about 
[ a third ]
of 
[ their gains ]
[ this year ]
, chalking up 
[ a 190.58-point ]
, or 
[ 6.9 % ]
, 
[ loss ]
on 
[ the day ]
in 
[ gargantuan trading volume ]
. 
[ Final-hour ]
trading accelerated to 
[ 108.1 million shares ]
, 
[ a record ]
for 
[ the Big Board ]
. 
At 
[ the end ]
of 
[ the day ]
, 
[ 251.2 million shares ]
were traded . 
[ The Dow Jones industrials ]
closed at 
[ 2569.26 ]
. 
[ The Dow 's decline ]
was 
[ second ]
in 
[ point terms ]
only to 
[ the 508-point Black Monday crash ]
[ that ]
occurred 
[ Oct. 19 ]
, 
[ 1987 ]
. 
In 
[ percentage terms ]
, however , 
[ the Dow 's dive ]
was 
[ the 12th-worst ]
ever and 
[ the sharpest ]
since 
[ the market ]
fell 
[ 156.83 ]
, or 
[ 8 % ]
, 
[ a week ]
after 
[ Black Monday ]
. 
[ The Dow ]
fell 
[ 22.6 % ]
on 
[ Black Monday ]
. 
[ Shares ]
of 
[ UAL ]
, 
[ the parent ]
of 
[ United Airlines ]
, were extremely 
[ active all day Friday ]
, reacting to 
[ news ]
and 
[ rumors ]
about 
[ the proposed $ 6.79 billion buy-out ]
of 
[ the airline ]
by 
[ an employee-management group ]
. 
[ Wall Street 's takeover-stock speculators ]
, or `` 
[ risk arbitragers ]
, '' had placed unusually 
[ large bets ]
that 
[ a takeover ]
would succeed and 
[ UAL stock ]
would rise . 
At 
[ 2:43 p.m. EDT ]
, came 
[ the sickening news ]
: 
[ The Big Board ]
was halting trading in 
[ UAL ]
, `` 
[ pending news ]
. 
'' On 
[ the exchange floor ]
, `` as soon as 
[ UAL ]
stopped trading , 
[ we ]
braced for 
[ a panic ]
, '' said 
[ one top floor trader ]
. 
[ Several traders ]
could be seen shaking 
[ their heads ]
when 
[ the news ]
flashed . 
For 
[ weeks ]
, 
[ the market ]
had been nervous about 
[ takeovers ]
, after 
[ Campeau Corp. 's cash crunch ]
spurred 
[ concern ]
about 
[ the prospects ]
for 
[ future ]
highly 
[ leveraged takeovers ]
. 
And 
[ 10 minutes ]
after 
[ the UAL trading halt ]
came 
[ news ]
that 
[ the UAL group ]
could n't get financing for 
[ its bid ]
. 
At 
[ this point ]
, 
[ the Dow ]
was down about 
[ 35 points ]
. 
[ The market ]
crumbled . 
[ Arbitragers ]
could n't dump 
[ their UAL stock ]
-- but 
[ they ]
rid 
[ themselves ]
of nearly 
[ every ]
`` 
[ rumor ]
'' 
[ stock ]
[ they ]
had . 
For 
[ example ]
, 
[ their selling ]
caused trading 
[ halts ]
to be declared in 
[ USAir Group ]
, 
[ which ]
closed down 
[ 3 7\/8 ]
to 
[ 41 1\/2 ]
, 
[ Delta Air Lines ]
, 
[ which ]
fell 
[ 7 3\/4 ]
to 
[ 69 1\/4 ]
, and 
[ Philips Industries ]
, 
[ which ]
sank 
[ 3 ]
to 
[ 21 1\/2 ]
. 
[ These stocks ]
eventually reopened . 
But as 
[ panic spread ]
, 
[ speculators ]
began to sell 
[ blue-chip stocks ]
such as 
[ Philip Morris ]
and 
[ International Business Machines ]
to offset 
[ their losses ]
. 
When trading was halted in 
[ Philip Morris ]
, 
[ the stock ]
was trading at 
[ 41 ]
, down 
[ 3 3\/8 ]
, while 
[ IBM ]
closed 
[ 5 5\/8 lower ]
at 
[ 102 ]
.
